## Hello everyone üëã
I began coding since I joined <a href="http://www.tmaxsoft.com/products/tibero/">TmaxTibero</a>, which is one of rare South Korean RDBMS companies with a product called Tibero.
Before joining TmaxTibero, I was a graduate student at <a href="https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/">KAIST</a> studying differential geometry.

## Projects I contributed so far üñ•Ô∏è
- <a href="https://github.com/myungbinkim/BoardGameScoreBoard">BoardGameScoreBoard</a>
  - My team at work loves playing board games, so we made an app for keeping the scores
  - /admin URI updates the scores, /scoreboard URI can let you view the current score
  - Stacks: JS, React, React Bootstrap, NodeJS
  - Things to improve:
    - User can't change player names dynamically
    - Two users can't change scores simultaneously
    - Design's not that pretty
- <a href="https://github.com/hwac99/trainer">Trainer</a>
  - Originally created to help new recruits in my team at work for coding practices
  - User writes solution codes for given problems, the program fetches data from DB and checks the solutions
  - Now that not many people use it at work, I got the approval of moving it to my personal github
  - Stacks: Python (client), C++ (server, solution framework), Boost library, Docker, CMake
  - Things to improve:
    - Tibero dependency (client library)
    - Automated DB instance (using docker)
    - GUI for client
